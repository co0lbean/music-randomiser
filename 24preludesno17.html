            <p>A Prelude is a short music piece - this is No.17 of the 24 Preludes. The Preludes cover all of the 24
                keys cycle (12 major
                and 12 minor). Each piece written in the major key is followed by its relative minor. The order of which
                they were written and presented in the catalogue is annotated in blue. <a
                    href="https://www.teoria.com/en/articles/2018/chopin-preludes/index.php">This</a> is a rather
                interesting way to display the preludes.

            </div>
            <p>Chopin himself has never played in public more than 4 preludes at once, and this trend continued for a
                few decades. Some say that they are meant to play continuously, whilst others suspect each is a short
                introductory, standalone piece for larger pieces. In modern times, the 24 Preludes have been performed
                in the correct sequence by big names such as
                Yuja Wang, lasting approximately 45 minutes in total.

            <h2>Interpretation</h2>
            <p><i>"She told me, I
                    love you"</i> is the name given by the French pianist <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Cortot">Alfred
                    Cortot</a> for this piece. Below is a short video from Fei Fei, interpreting the piece by its
                nickname.

            <p>Fei Fei describes the first two bars of repeated chords as the heart fluttering (annotated in blue),
                very gently expressed via piano ("p" circled in red). The first statement of the theme starts
                after that (indicated by first orange arrow), where it is continued to be played very softly - a
                woman telling a man that she loves him.</p>
            <p> The second statement is played with forte, where perhaps it is used to describe the joy and
                realisation of the man, reciprocating
                his love for her.</p>
