            <h2>Background information</h2>
            <p>An <i>impromptu</i> is a piece of music written in the spirit of improvisation, usually for a solo instrument. In this case, it is for the piano.</p>
            <p>This gentle, somewhat melancholic piece is the third piece of the Four Impromptus, composed by Schubert in 1827, however, only the first two were published during his lifetime. Impromptu no. 3 was made public posthumously, and was published in G major instead of Gâ™­ major for many years.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Horowitz's performance made playing the piece look efforless - it seemed as though like his fingers were barely gliding on the keys, yet was able to make such beautiful sounds. Despite being short and sounding simple, it's regarded to be a hard piece to execute, with difficulties coming from getting the motifs and moods right.
