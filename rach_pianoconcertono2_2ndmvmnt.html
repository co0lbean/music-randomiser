        <p>It is worth noting that yes, this piece is roughly 10 minutes long (x3 the length of a conventional pop song). But it is very magical, and the story behind it is quite interesting too.</p>
        <div class="information">

            <h2>Background information</h2>
            <p>This is the second of three movements of Rachmaninoff's <i>Piano Concerto no. 2</i> (also known as <i>Rach 2</i>) written from 1900-1901.
            </p>
            <p>Prior to composing this piece, Rachmaninoff has been working on his First Symphony. After several
                revisions, it was premiered and unfortunately was heavily criticised. Aside from issues with the piece
                itself, it was thought that the drunken conductor also contributed to the disastrous performance. Rachmaninoff
                himself was watching at the backstage and left promptly as it ended to avoid embarrassment.
            </p>

            </p>
            </div>    
            <p>Failure of the First Symphony launched Rachmaninoff into a long bout of depression, where he had a psychological breakdown
                and wasn't able to compose for the next three years. He fell into alcoholism, and was still performing even though he had temporarily stopped writing. In the end he resorted to teaching piano lessons for income.
            </p>
            <p>Rachmaninoff wrote the first movement for piano concerto no. 2 with difficulties before the writer's block. The concerto remained unfinished, until he was introduced to Nikolai Dahl, a neurologist who specialised in hypnosis. Daily visits with musical discussions (for Nikolai himself was also a composer) in the course of roughly three months revived Rachmaninoff. <cite>"the material grew in bulk, and new musical ideas began to stir within me‚Äîfar more than I needed for my concerto"</cite> - He wrote to his biographer. Rachmaninoff found the inspiration to compose again, completing his second piano concerto and dedicated it to Nikolai Dahl.</p>

            <p>Rachmaninoff is one of the few composers who had recordings of himself playing. Due to copyright reasons the recording can't be embedded on this website, but you can always check it out on Youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/pBx-tr1FDvY">here</a>.</p>

            <p>The second movement has served as an inspiration to many songs and film soundtracks, specifically because of this melody:</p>
            <div class="sheet">
                <a href="https://musescore.com/user/32106469/scores/6078161">
                <img src="rach2mov2melody.png">
                </a> 
                Eric Carmen, a classically trained musician, sampled the piece for the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGrLb6W5YOM&ab_channel=CelineDionVEVO">All By Myself</a>. Although it is in the US public domain, this is not the case for everywhere else and the Rachmaninoff estate was therefore able to claim 12% of the royalties made from the song.</p>
                <p>Rachmaninoff pieces are generally perceived to be difficult to execute on the piano as he was known to have gigantic hands.</p>
            <div class="interpretation">
                <h2>Interpretation</h2>
                <p>In contrast to his first movement, the second movement sounds brighter, a bit like stepping into a fairytale.</p>
                <!--do the hover function for "cadenza" definition-->
            <p>The sheets referenced below includes the popular melody followed by the cadenza, (last few minutes of the piece) then the ending. To save space, only the parts for piano and violins are depicted - other instruments involved are flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trombones, trumpets, tuba, timpani, viola, cello, and double bass. </p>
            <p>In the video referenced above with the pianist being Khatia Buniatishvili, this part starts at 8:59. In Anna Fedorova's version, this starts at 21:35 and ends at 23:50. A comparison could be made to decide which interpretation is preferred.</p>

            <p>This movement, and passage in particular, give the listener a sense of hope and relief. Perhaps it was how Rachmaninoff felt seeing the light again after making it out of a dark period of his life.

            <div class="final words">
                <h2>Final words</h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully this beautiful piece has inspired you to listen to the whole concerto. Each movement has its own colour and emotions. The first movement depicts the despair during his depression, transitioning to a more hopeful second movement, and ends with more epic tones, signifying his rising again as a musician.
