## Random Classical Music Generator
Hello! This website is a combination of two of my favourite things - classical music and coding. I wanted to make classical music more accessible to the general public by randomising a list of pieces under 10 minutes. I've designed the background and annotated any diagrams myself. Hope you'll find something enjoyable here :)
