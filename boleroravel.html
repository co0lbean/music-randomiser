                This piece is interpreted in different tempos. There are ongoing debates as to which tempo it is meant to be played at - 100 bpm (see above), or 50 bpm or under (as below).<!--hover over to explain "beats per minute"-->

            <h2>Background information</h2>
            <p>This piece is <i>Kinderscenen</i> (Scenes of Childhood) Op. 15, No. 7 (1838), or better known as <i>Träumerei</i> (Dreaming). Originally 30 movements were written for this set, but Schumann narrowed it down to thirteen. The set is inspired by his wife, also a renowned pianist at the time Clara Schumann, remarked that his behaviours sometimes seemed "like a child". He noted that the pieces in this series sounds brighter and more light-hearted than his other works. It is written to capture the nature of children - innocence, vulnerability, but it is not written for children.
            </p>
            
            <p>Most recordings found on YouTube nowadays opt for a slower tempo, perhaps as an attempt to convey the dream-like atmosphere of the title of the piece. Some argued that originally it should be played at a higher tempo, i.e. 100bpm, as evident from tempo markings in the original score. A faster pace give the piece less dreamy, more playful mood, that fits into the theme of the whole set about childhood and Schumann's child-like nature.

                However, others disagreed about the authenticity of the so-called first edition score, saying it has later been revised and edited by Clara Schumann, who changed the tempo of which the piece should've been played at. Some even went as far as saying the score notations didn't matter much with the composers now having quite literally decomposed, and that it is up to the performers to make their own interpretations. After all, the versions with the slower tempo are more popular, even though that may not have been the original intention of how it should have been played.

        <h2>WWII</h2>
            <p> On May 8th 1945, also known as Victory Day, <i>Träumerei</i> was played on Radio Moscow during the Minute of Silence as rememberance for Russians who died during WWII. A choir version is subsequently used many years after that and to this day at WWII memorial ceremonies.

            <h2>Interpretation</h2>
            <p>Depending on the tempo, the piece could give a different colour. For example, when played more slowly, there is a more melancholic feel to it - however, when played at a higher tempo, it gives off a playful atmostphere, which captures theme of the series.</p>
